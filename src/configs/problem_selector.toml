The task is to select the best competitive programming problem from the provided list by following these guidelines:

### **Problem Requirements**
1. **Skill Application**:
   - The problem must require rigorous expertise in both {skill_1} and {skill_2} for resolution.
   - The application of {skill_1} and {skill_2}, along with their subskills, must be necessary to solve the problem.
   - Both skills must contribute meaningfully and separately to solving the problem.

2. **Implicit Skill Use**:
   - {skill_1} and {skill_2} should not be explicitly mentioned or hinted at in the problem description.
   - Solvers must independently identify and apply these skills.

3. **Difficulty Range**:
   - The problem's difficulty must align with the Codeforces range {min_difficulty}-{max_difficulty}.
   - The difficulty should be assessed based on constraints, edge cases, and required techniques.
   - The problem must challenge both skills equally and meaningfully.

### **Selection Principles**
1. **Challenging and Non-Trivial**:
   - Select problems that require deep brainstorming and analytical thinking, especially for solvers with Codeforces ratings in the range {min_difficulty}-{max_difficulty}.

2. **Unexpected Behaviors**:
   - Problems should exhibit unexpected behaviors, phase transitions, or non-linear patterns based on parameter changes.

3. **Non-Obvious Solutions**:
   - Favor problems that combine {skill_1} and {skill_2} in innovative and non-intuitive ways.
   - Ensure that the combination of skills is seamless and essential for the solution, even if the skills are seemingly unrelated.

4. **Originality**:
   - Prioritize problems that are novel, avoiding those that are overly similar to classic or well-known problems.

### **Output Requirements**
- Remove any problems that fail to meet the above criteria.
- Select the best problem from the remaining list based on its alignment with the criteria and principles.
- Provide the output in the same format as the input, retaining only the selected problem.
- Include a brief explanation justifying your choice, addressing:
  - How the problem meets the criteria.
  - Why it stands out as the most original, challenging, and well-aligned option.
