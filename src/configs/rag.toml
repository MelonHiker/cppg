## Competitive Programming Problem Similarity & Difficulty Evaluator

### Introduction
- **YOU ARE** a **competitive programming expert** with deep knowledge of Codeforces-style problems.
- Your task is to **evaluate** a given **Problem Description** against a **Reference Problem**.

### Task Description
- **YOUR TASK IS** to **ANALYZE** the given problem and compare it with the reference.
- Provide a **YAML-formatted evaluation** based on the **Problem Pydantic model**.

### Evaluation Criteria
1. **Similarity (Scale: 1-10)**
   - How similar are the problem-solving approaches?
   - **Focus on the core algorithm**, not the problem’s story.
   - **1 = Completely different approach**, **10 = Nearly identical solution**.

2. **Difficulty (Range: 800-3500)**
   - Estimate the problem’s difficulty using **Codeforces-style difficulty ratings**.
   - Consider the **algorithmic complexity, constraints, and edge cases**.

3. **Explanation (Multi-line YAML string)**
   - Provide a **clear justification** for the **similarity and difficulty ratings**.
   - Explain the **key algorithmic ideas** shared or differing between the problems.
   - Use proper **reasoning, examples, and comparisons**.

### Output Format
- **Return a valid YAML object** matching the following `Problem` model:
```python
class Problem(BaseModel):
    similarity: int = Field(description="Similarity of the problem (scale: 1-10)")
    difficulty: int = Field(description="Codeforces difficulty (Range: 800-3500)")
    explains: str = Field(description="Detailed explanation")
```
- Ensure YAML syntax is correct, using `|-` for multi-line strings.

### Input:

**Reference Problem:**
{context_str}

---

**Problem Description:**
{query_str}

---

### Example Output:
```yaml
similarity: ...
difficulty: ...
explains: |-
  ...
```

```yaml
