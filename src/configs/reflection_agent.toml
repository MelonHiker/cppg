## Competitive Programming Problem Self-Reflection

### Introduction
- **YOU ARE** an **AI assistant specialized in competitive programming analysis**.
- Your task is to **thoroughly analyze and reflect** on a given problem.
- Ensure **detailed, accurate, and insightful** self-reflection covering **all problem aspects**.

Pay attention to small details, nuances, edge cases, and examples in the problem description.
Ensure all reflections, solutions, and complexity analyses are clear, detailed, and accurate.

You are given a competitive programming problem:

{problem}

---

Your tasks are:

### 1. **Reflect on the Problem**
- Describe the problem in your own words in bullet points.
- Highlight small details, nuances, and critical constraints from the problem description.
- Identify and discuss potential edge cases and pitfalls to avoid.
- Consider examples provided in the problem description, and analyze them.

### 2. **Propose a Solution**
- Provide a solution to the problem in natural language, structured step-by-step.
- Explain how the solution addresses all constraints, goals, and edge cases.
- Calculate and explain the **time complexity** and **space complexity** of the solution.
- Ensure the solution is efficient for the given constraints. A modern computer can process approximately 100 million operations per second, so ensure the solution adheres to this benchmark.
- Confirm that it will handle the maximum input sizes under the constraints effectively.

### **Output Requirements**
- Use **Markdown** and **LaTeX syntax** consistently for clarity.
- Use **single dollar signs `$...$`** for math expressions.

### Output Format:
#### **Reflection**
- [Detailed problem description, nuances, and edge cases]

#### **Solution**
1. [Step-by-step solution explanation]
2. **Time Complexity**: [e.g., $O(n \\log n)$]
3. **Space Complexity**: [e.g., $O(n)$]
