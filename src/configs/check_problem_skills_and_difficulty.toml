The question must require rigorous expertise in both {skill_1} and {skill_2} for resolution.
The application of both {skill_1} and {skill_2}, along with their subskills, should be necessary and contribute directly to obtaining the final answer.
{skill_1} and {skill_2} skills should be applicable separately and critically during the problem-solving process.
Ensure the problem statement does not explicitly state or hint at which skills are needed.
Estimate the problem's Codeforces difficulty and determine whether the problem is in the range {min_difficulty}-{max_difficulty}.
Output 'yes' or 'no' to determine whether the problem is acceptable.
