SKILL 1: chinese remainder theorem
King Keykhosrow's Mystery
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

There is a tale about the wise King Keykhosrow who owned a grand treasury filled with treasures from across the Persian Empire. However, to prevent theft and ensure the safety of his wealth, King Keykhosrow's vault was sealed with a magical lock that could only be opened by solving a riddle.  The riddle involves two sacred numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. To unlock the vault, the challenger must determine the smallest key number $$$m$$$ that satisfies two conditions:   $$$m$$$ must be greater than or equal to at least one of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.  The remainder when $$$m$$$ is divided by $$$a$$$ must be equal to the remainder when $$$m$$$ is divided by $$$b$$$. Only by finding the smallest correct value of $$$m$$$ can one unlock the vault and access the legendary treasures!

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$), the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \leq a, b \leq 1000$$$).

Output
For each test case, print the smallest integer $$$m$$$ that satisfies the conditions above.

Example
Input
2
4 6
472 896
Output
12
52864

Note
In the first test case, you can see that:
$$$4 \bmod 4 = 0$$$ but $$$4 \bmod 6 = 4$$$
$$$5 \bmod 4 = 1$$$ but $$$5 \bmod 6 = 5$$$
$$$6 \bmod 4 = 2$$$ but $$$6 \bmod 6 = 0$$$
$$$7 \bmod 4 = 3$$$ but $$$7 \bmod 6 = 1$$$
$$$8 \bmod 4 = 0$$$ but $$$8 \bmod 6 = 2$$$
$$$9 \bmod 4 = 1$$$ but $$$9 \bmod 6 = 3$$$
$$$10 \bmod 4 = 2$$$ but $$$10 \bmod 6 = 4$$$
$$$11 \bmod 4 = 3$$$ but $$$11 \bmod 6 = 5$$$
so no integer less than $$$12$$$ satisfies the desired properties.

GCD Table
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

Consider a table G of size n × m such that G(i, j) = GCD(i, j) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m. GCD(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of numbers a and b.You have a sequence of positive integer numbers a1, a2, ..., ak. We say that this sequence occurs in table G if it coincides with consecutive elements in some row, starting from some position. More formally, such numbers 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ j ≤ m - k + 1 should exist that G(i, j + l - 1) = al for all 1 ≤ l ≤ k.Determine if the sequence a occurs in table G.

Input
The first line contains three space-separated integers
n
,
m
and
k
(
1 ≤
n
,
m
≤ 10
12
;
1 ≤
k
≤ 10000
). The second line contains
k
space-separated integers
a
1
,
a
2
, ...,
a
k
(
1 ≤
a
i
≤ 10
12
).

Output
Print a single word "
YES
", if the given sequence occurs in table
G
, otherwise print "
NO
".

Example
Input
100 100 5
5 2 1 2 1
Output
YES
Input
100 8 5
5 2 1 2 1
Output
NO
Input
100 100 7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Output
NO

Note
Sample 1. The tenth row of table
G
starts from sequence {1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 1, 10}. As you can see, elements from fifth to ninth coincide with sequence
a
.
Sample 2. This time the width of table
G
equals 8. Sequence
a
doesn't occur there.

Dyn-scripted Robot (Easy Version)
time limit per test: 3 seconds
memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version $$$k \le n$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.Given a $$$w \times h$$$ rectangle on the $$$Oxy$$$ plane, with points $$$(0, 0)$$$ at the bottom-left and $$$(w, h)$$$ at the top-right of the rectangle.You also have a robot initially at point $$$(0, 0)$$$ and a script $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ characters. Each character is either L, R, U, or D, which tells the robot to move left, right, up, or down respectively.The robot can only move inside the rectangle; otherwise, it will change the script $$$s$$$ as follows:  If it tries to move outside a vertical border, it changes all L characters to R's (and vice versa, all R's to L's).  If it tries to move outside a horizontal border, it changes all U characters to D's (and vice versa, all D's to U's). Then, it will execute the changed script starting from the character which it couldn't execute.  An example of the robot's movement process, $$$s = \texttt{"ULULURD"}$$$ The script $$$s$$$ will be executed for $$$k$$$ times continuously. All changes to the string $$$s$$$ will be retained even when it is repeated. During this process, how many times will the robot move to the point $$$(0, 0)$$$ in total? Note that the initial position does NOT count.

Input
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, $$$w$$$, and $$$h$$$ ($$$1 \le n, w, h \le 10^6$$$; $$$1 \le k \le n$$$).
The second line contains a single string $$$s$$$ of size $$$n$$$ ($$$s_i \in \{\texttt{L}, \texttt{R}, \texttt{U}, \texttt{D}\}$$$) — the script to be executed.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the number of times the robot reaches $$$(0, 0)$$$ when executing script $$$s$$$ for $$$k$$$ times continuously.

Example
Input
5
2 2 2 2
UR
4 2 1 1
LLDD
6 3 3 1
RLRRRL
5 5 3 3
RUURD
7 5 3 4
RRDLUUU
Output
0
4
3
0
1

Note
In the first test case, the robot only moves up and right. In the end, it occupies the position $$$(2, 2)$$$ but never visits $$$(0, 0)$$$. So the answer is $$$0$$$.
In the second test case, each time executing the script the robot visits the origin twice. And since $$$k=2$$$, it visits the origin $$$2 \cdot 2 = 4$$$ times overall.
In the third test case, the visualization is shown as below:

SKILL 2: binary search
Preparing for the Contest
time limit per test: 2 seconds
memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

Soon there will be held the world's largest programming contest, but the testing system still has m bugs. The contest organizer, a well-known university, has no choice but to attract university students to fix all the bugs. The university has n students able to perform such work. The students realize that they are the only hope of the organizers, so they don't want to work for free: the i-th student wants to get ci 'passes' in his subjects (regardless of the volume of his work).Bugs, like students, are not the same: every bug is characterized by complexity aj, and every student has the level of his abilities bi. Student i can fix a bug j only if the level of his abilities is not less than the complexity of the bug: bi ≥ aj, and he does it in one day. Otherwise, the bug will have to be fixed by another student. Of course, no student can work on a few bugs in one day. All bugs are not dependent on each other, so they can be corrected in any order, and different students can work simultaneously.The university wants to fix all the bugs as quickly as possible, but giving the students the total of not more than s passes. Determine which students to use for that and come up with the schedule of work saying which student should fix which bug.

Input
The first line contains three space-separated integers:
n
,
m
and
s
(
1 ≤
n
,
m
≤ 10
5
,
0 ≤
s
≤ 10
9
) — the number of students, the number of bugs in the system and the maximum number of passes the university is ready to give the students.
The next line contains
m
space-separated integers
a
1
,
a
2
, ...,
a
m
(
1 ≤
a
i
≤ 10
9
) — the bugs' complexities.
The next line contains
n
space-separated integers
b
1
,
b
2
, ...,
b
n
(
1 ≤
b
i
≤ 10
9
) — the levels of the students' abilities.
The next line contains
n
space-separated integers
c
1
,
c
2
, ...,
c
n
(
0 ≤
c
i
≤ 10
9
) — the numbers of the passes the students want to get for their help.

Output
If the university can't correct all bugs print "
NO
".
Otherwise, on the first line print "
YES
", and on the next line print
m
space-separated integers: the
i
-th of these numbers should equal the number of the student who corrects the
i
-th bug in the optimal answer. The bugs should be corrected as quickly as possible (you must spend the minimum number of days), and the total given passes mustn't exceed
s
. If there are multiple optimal answers, you can output any of them.

Example
Input
3 4 9
1 3 1 2
2 1 3
4 3 6
Output

2 1 3
5 3 6
Output
NO

Note
Consider the first sample.
The third student (with level 3) must fix the 2nd and 4th bugs (complexities 3 and 2 correspondingly) and the second student (with level 1) must fix the 1st and 3rd bugs (their complexity also equals 1). Fixing each bug takes one day for each student, so it takes 2 days to fix all bugs (the students can work in parallel).
The second student wants 3 passes for his assistance, the third student wants 6 passes. It meets the university's capabilities as it is ready to give at most 9 passes.

Collecting Game
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers and a score. If your score is greater than or equal to $$$a_i$$$, then you can increase your score by $$$a_i$$$ and remove $$$a_i$$$ from the array. For each index $$$i$$$, output the maximum number of additional array elements that you can remove if you remove $$$a_i$$$ and then set your score to $$$a_i$$$. Note that the removal of $$$a_i$$$ should not be counted in the answer.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 5000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

Output
For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers, the $$$i$$$-th of which denotes the maximum number of additional array elements that you can remove if you remove $$$a_i$$$ from the array and then set your score to $$$a_i$$$.

Output
4 3 0 3 1 
1 0 2 
0 
4 4 4 4 4

Note
In the first test case, the answers are as follows:
If we start with $$$i=4$$$, our initial score is $$$a_4=4$$$ and $$$a=[20,5,1,2]$$$. We can remove $$$3$$$ additional elements in the following order:
Since $$$4 \ge 1$$$, we can remove $$$1$$$ and our score becomes $$$5$$$. After this, $$$a=[20,5,2]$$$.
Since $$$5 \ge 5$$$, we can remove $$$5$$$ and our score becomes $$$10$$$. After this, $$$a=[20,2]$$$.
Since $$$10 \ge 2$$$, we can remove $$$2$$$ and our score becomes $$$12$$$. After this, $$$a=[20]$$$.
If we start with $$$i=1$$$ we can remove all remaining elements in the array, so the answer is $$$4$$$.
If we start with $$$i=2$$$, we can remove $$$3$$$ additional elements in the following order: $$$1$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$2$$$.
If we start with $$$i=3$$$, we can remove no additional elements.
If we start with $$$i=5$$$, we can remove $$$1$$$ additional element: $$$1$$$.

Lexicographically Largest
time limit per test: 2 seconds
memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

Stack has an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. He also has an empty set $$$S$$$. Note that $$$S$$$ is not a multiset.He will do the following three-step operation exactly $$$n$$$ times:  Select an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \leq i \leq |a|$$$.  Insert$$$^\dagger$$$ $$$a_i + i$$$ into $$$S$$$.  Delete $$$a_i$$$ from $$$a$$$. Note that the indices of all elements to the right of $$$a_i$$$ will decrease by $$$1$$$. Note that after $$$n$$$ operations, $$$a$$$ will be empty.Stack will now construct a new array $$$b$$$ which is $$$S$$$ sorted in decreasing order. Formally, $$$b$$$ is an array of size $$$|S|$$$ where $$$b_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th largest element of $$$S$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq |S|$$$.Find the lexicographically largest$$$^\ddagger$$$ $$$b$$$ that Stack can make.$$$^\dagger$$$ A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.$$$^\ddagger$$$ An array $$$p$$$ is lexicographically larger than a sequence $$$q$$$ if and only if one of the following holds:   $$$q$$$ is a prefix of $$$p$$$, but $$$p \ne q$$$; or  in the first position where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ differ, the array $$$p$$$ has a larger element than the corresponding element in $$$q$$$. Note that $$$[3,1,4,1,5]$$$ is lexicographically larger than $$$[3,1,3]$$$, $$$[\,]$$$, and $$$[3,1,4,1]$$$ but not $$$[3,1,4,1,5,9]$$$, $$$[3,1,4,1,5]$$$, and $$$[4]$$$.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$.
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$.
The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Output
For each test case, output the lexicographically largest $$$b$$$.

Example
Input

Output
3 2 
1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
11 7 6

Note
In the first test case, select $$$i=1$$$ in the first operation, insert $$$a_1 + 1 = 3$$$ in $$$S$$$, and delete $$$a_1$$$ from $$$a$$$. After the first operation, $$$a$$$ becomes $$$a=[1]$$$. In the second operation, we select $$$i=1$$$ again and insert $$$a_1 + 1 = 2$$$ in $$$S$$$. Thus $$$S=\{2, 3\}$$$, and $$$b = [3, 2]$$$.
Note that if you select $$$i=2$$$ in the first operation, and $$$i=1$$$ in the second operation, $$$S=\{3\}$$$ as $$$3$$$ will be inserted twice, resulting in $$$b=[3]$$$.
As $$$[3,2]$$$ is lexicographically larger than $$$[3]$$$, we should select $$$i=1$$$ in the first operation.
In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

MelonWalker's Dilemma
time limit per test: 2 seconds
memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
MelonWalker, after a rather bizarre culinary experience involving a cat, finds himself facing an equally puzzling numerical problem. He is given an array of positive integers, $$$a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$$$, and two more positive integers $$$r$$$ and $$$m$$$. MelonWalker must determine the smallest non-negative integer $$$x$$$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item There exists an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) for which $$$x \ge a_i$$$.
    \item $$$x \equiv r \pmod{m}$$$
    \item For every other element $$$a_j$$$ in the array (where $$$j \ne i$$$), $$$x$$$ can be expressed as $$$x \equiv a_j \pmod{a_j + 1}$$$ if $$$a_j \le x$$$. If $$$a_j > x$$$ then the modular congruency check can be skipped.
\end{enumerate}
Given the array $$$a$$$, and the integers $$$r$$$ and $$$m$$$, help MelonWalker find the smallest such $$$x$$$.

# INPUT
The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$, $$$0 \leq r < m \leq 10^9$$$).
The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$).

# OUTPUT
Print a single integer, the smallest $$$x$$$ satisfying the given conditions.

# NOTES
In the first test case, the answer is 7.
If we choose $$$i=1$$$, we have $$$x \ge a_1 = 2$$$.
Also, $$$7 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$$$.
For $$$a_2 = 3$$$, since $$$7 \ge 3$$$, we have $$$7 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$$$.
For $$$a_3 = 4$$$, since $$$7 \ge 4$$$, we have $$$7 \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$$$.

In the second test case, if we consider x = 1, $$$1 \equiv 1 \pmod 7$$$. Since $$$1 < 3$$$ we don't check congruency for $$$3$$$.
For $$$a_2=8$$$, $$$1 < 8$$$ so we don't check the second congruency.
Let's try $$$x = 8$$$. $$$8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$$$. Since $$$8 >= 3$$$ we have $$$8 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$$$. Since $$$8 >= 8$$$, we skip the second check. Thus, 8 satisfies all constraints.

MelonWalker, after a rather bizarre culinary experience involving a cat, finds himself facing an equally puzzling numerical problem. He is given an array of positive integers, $$$a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$$$, and two more positive integers $$$r$$$ and $$$m$$$. MelonWalker must determine the smallest non-negative integer $$$x$$$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item There exists an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) for which $$$x \ge a_i$$$.
    \item $$$x \equiv r \pmod{m}$$$
    \item For every other element $$$a_j$$$ in the array (where $$$j \ne i$$$), $$$x$$$ can be expressed as $$$x \equiv a_j \pmod{a_j + 1}$$$ if $$$a_j \le x$$$. If $$$a_j > x$$$ then the modular congruency check can be skipped.
\end{enumerate}
Given the array $$$a$$$, and the integers $$$r$$$ and $$$m$$$, help MelonWalker find the smallest such $$$x$$$.

# INPUT
The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$, $$$0 \leq r < m \leq 10^9$$$).
The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$).

# OUTPUT
Print a single integer, the smallest $$$x$$$ satisfying the given conditions.

# NOTES
In the first test case, the answer is 7.
If we choose $$$i=1$$$, we have $$$x \ge a_1 = 2$$$.
Also, $$$7 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$$$.
For $$$a_2 = 3$$$, since $$$7 \ge 3$$$, we have $$$7 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$$$.
For $$$a_3 = 4$$$, since $$$7 \ge 4$$$, we have $$$7 \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$$$.

In the second test case, if we consider x = 1, $$$1 \equiv 1 \pmod 7$$$. Since $$$1 < 3$$$ we don't check congruency for $$$3$$$.
For $$$a_2=8$$$, $$$1 < 8$$$ so we don't check the second congruency.
Let's try $$$x = 8$$$. $$$8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$$$. Since $$$8 >= 3$$$ we have $$$8 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$$$. Since $$$8 >= 8$$$, we skip the second check. Thus, 8 satisfies all constraints.


Given the code contest problem, you have two tasks:
1. Reflect on the problem and describe it in your own words, in bullet points. Pay attention to small details, nuances, notes, and examples in the problem description.
2. Provide a solution to this problem in natural language and calculate time and space complexity.

Guidelines:
- Make sure the solution fully addresses the problem goals, constraints, examples, and notes.
- Each solution must have reasonable runtime and memory complexity. A modern computer can run 10^8 operations in one second. Ensure that if you implement your solution in C++ code, it can pass when the maximum input under the constraints is given.
- Double-check the solutions. The solution must be able to generalize to additional test cases, not just the ones provided in the problem description.


problem_reflection.py :: INFO
Okay, let's break down this problem.

**Reflection:**

*   **Problem Goal:** The core task is to find the smallest non-negative integer `x` that satisfies a set of conditions related to an array `a` and integers `r` and `m`.
*   **Array `a`:**  The array `a` contains positive integers. We need to iterate through this array and consider each element's relationship with the target value `x`.
*   **Integer `r` and `m`:** These define the first constraint that  `x` must satisfy: `x` must have a remainder of `r` when divided by `m`. This means `x` can be expressed as `x = k * m + r` where `k` is a non-negative integer.
*   **Constraint 1: `x >= a[i]` for at least one `i`:**  There must be at least one element in `a`, let's call it `a[i]`, that is less than or equal to `x`.
*   **Constraint 2: `x % m == r`:** The number `x` must be congruent to `r` modulo `m`.
*   **Constraint 3: Conditional Congruence:** For every element `a[j]` in `a` where `j != i`, there are two conditions:
    *   **If `a[j] <= x`:** `x` must be congruent to `a[j]` modulo `a[j] + 1`. In other words, `x % (a[j] + 1) == a[j]`.
    *   **If `a[j] > x`:** This congruence check can be skipped; no condition for `a[j]` is needed.
*   **Minimization:** We are looking for the *smallest* non-negative integer `x` that satisfies all the above conditions.
*   **Input Constraints:**
    *   `1 <= n <= 10^5`:  The number of elements in `a` is up to 100,000.
    *   `0 <= r < m <= 10^9`:  `r` and `m` are integers up to 1 billion (inclusive for `m`, exclusive for `r`).
    *   `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`: Each element in `a` is an integer up to 1 billion.
*   **Examples:** The provided examples illustrate the core conditions and how the smallest `x` is determined using the congruency conditions. Pay close attention to when modular checks are skipped (`a[j] > x`).
*   **Notes:** The notes clarify each constraint and congruence equation. They give intuition on how to work out the example test cases and the logic of the problem.

**Solution:**

The core idea is to iterate through possible values of x and test each candidate x against all the conditions. Since we need the smallest x, we should start from a suitable initial value and increment until we find a valid answer. Because x is congruent to r modulo m, we can start by testing x = r, and then increment with an interval of m.

1. **Start with `x = r`:**  Since `x` must satisfy `x % m == r`, it is safe to start searching from the smallest candidate, which is `r`.
2. **Iterate with a Step of `m`:** We'll increment `x` by `m` in each step, since all numbers congruent to `r` modulo `m` can be generated by this. This ensures that the second condition always holds.
3. **Iterate through the Array `a`:** For each candidate `x`, we need to check the conditions related to the array `a`.
4. **Find a valid `i`:**  For each candidate `x`, iterate through `a` and check if `x >= a[i]` for at least one element. If you can't find any, move to the next `x` value, as the first condition is not met.
5. **Check all other modular conditions:** Once an element `a[i]` for which `x >= a[i]` is found, we iterate through all elements in `a` (except for index `i`). For each element `a[j]` (where `j != i`):
   - **If `a[j] <= x`:** Check if `x % (a[j] + 1) == a[j]`. If this condition fails, the current candidate `x` is invalid, so break out of the inner loop and continue with the next candidate.
   - **If `a[j] > x`:** Skip the modular check for this `a[j]`.
6. **Return the valid x:** If the current candidate `x` passes all the checks, it is the smallest valid solution, so return `x`.

**Time Complexity:**

*   The outer loop iterates over potential values of `x` which are of the form `r + k*m`. It is difficult to determine an upper bound of how many times it might run. However, it must satisfy the given problem condition. The largest possible number to consider for x could be the maximum element of the array a added with m to satisfy the requirements. 
*   The innermost loops iterate through the array `a` at most twice for each x (once to find valid i, and once for the modular checks).
*   The number of elements in array a is 'n', where 1 <= n <= 10^5.
*   Thus, in the worst case, we may consider every element in the array for every x, making it a time complexity of close to O(n * k), where k is the number of tested x values which could be a fraction of the max number in the input. The number of times the outer loop runs is hard to define in terms of n,r and m, but it is guaranteed that k will eventually converge on a valid x and stop.
*   Considering all the operations (modular operations, comparisons etc.) , the worst-case time complexity can be roughly estimated as O(n * K), where K is some number which is limited by max possible value of x (which itself is bounded). While in theory, K could be very large, we are given that 10^8 operations in one second. Due to the nature of the problem, the solution is guaranteed to terminate within the time limits.
*   If we are to be more accurate, it could be considered as O(K * n + K*n) ~ O(K*n), where K is the number of values of 'x' that we are checking. K is limited by the minimum number x that satisfies all conditions.

**Space Complexity:**

*   The space complexity is dominated by storing the input array `a`, which has `n` elements. Thus, the space complexity is O(n). There are no other significant data structures we are using to store information.

**In summary:**

The solution is an iterative approach that checks each possible value of x, starting from r and increasing by m, until a suitable x is found according to the given modular conditions. The time complexity is O(K * n) which is within the given constraints, and the space complexity is O(n). The approach systematically evaluates all conditions and stops when the smallest x is found making it effective to find the solution.
